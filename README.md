- We Teach Mindful Programming, IT Development, DevOps Strategy and the Art of Zen Tech Leadership. Students gain experience and work with experts in development to become Bushido Coders.
- We have Senior Developers who volunteer their time to create easy to understand, yet very in-depth training material to lead the programmers of tomorrow. With over 20 yearsâ€™ experience in IT development while leading international teams in startups, we have found a clear disconnect between those who have a desire to code and those who have mastered the art. This free coding academy breaks down the philosophy of IT and teaches how it is a poetic artistic expression. We expand the mind of the student to understand new literacy.
- We share industry-standard resources such as LeetCode and TeamBlind so those seeking career advancement have access to the best tools available. Our senior developers have Live Streams where participants can follow along as we create enterprise-level software and IT Solutions.
